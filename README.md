## Installation Instructions

Run the following commands (assuming you have `python -V >= 3.11`)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JasonGrace2282/asSISt.git
cd asSISt
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py migrate # create database stuff
python3 manage.py runserver # to host website locally
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)) in your preferred web browser.

On future launches, all you should have to do is navigate to the cloned directory (`asSISt` in this case)
and run the last command

## Known Bugs
- The program crashes with an `IndexError` if the gradebook doesn't have any assignments

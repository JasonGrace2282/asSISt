    <p>This project is built for HackTJ to make the lives of students easier. Our mission is to make a
        system that enables students to calculate their grades anywhere on the go. With our technology,
        students can allocate their time to classes that need it most and avoid wasting valuable effort.
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">How to use</h3>
    <p>
      To use our program, start by clicking
      <p><a href="https://github.com/JasonGrace2282/hacktj24" title="on this link" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-blue">on this link</a></p>. Scroll down and follow the installation instructions below 
      and run "main.py". 
      Next, enter in your Username and Password. Then enter in the domain of your studentvue 
      website. For example, if you attend Fairfax County Schools, you would enter the domain "sisstudent.fcps.edu/SVUE".
      <br>
      <br>
      Then, you choose a subject to simulate grades for. Once you've done that, you can view your grades normally, or you can 
      add custom assignments to simulate your grades. To do this, click the plus sign and then fill out the simulated grade's name
      , points possible, points earned, and weight category. This will give you a new simulated grade that will factor into your
      class grade average.
      <br>
      <br>
      This feature helps our users to figure out their grades before their teachers put them into the gradebook, or work
      out scenarios and strategize where to allocate your time when you study to make sure you can spread out your attention
      to where it's important.
